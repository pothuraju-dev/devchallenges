## Flexbox Properties

### `display: flex`
Turns the parent container into a flex container, allowing its child elements to be laid out using the Flexbox layout system.

### `flex-direction`
Specifies the direction in which the flex items are laid out within the flex container. Possible values:
- `row` (default): Items are laid out horizontally from left to right.
- `row-reverse`: Items are laid out horizontally from right to left.
- `column`: Items are laid out vertically from top to bottom.
- `column-reverse`: Items are laid out vertically from bottom to top.

### `justify-content`
Defines how the flex items are distributed along the main axis of the flex container. Possible values:
- `flex-start` (default): Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.
- `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end of the flex container.
- `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around each item.
- `space-evenly`: Items are evenly spaced with equal space between them.

### `align-items`
Defines how the flex items are distributed along the cross axis of the flex container. Possible values:
- `stretch` (default): Items are stretched to fill the container's cross-axis.
- `flex-start`: Items are packed toward the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
- `baseline`: Items are aligned to their baselines.

### `align-content`
Defines how multiple lines of flex items are distributed along the cross axis. This property only takes effect when there are multiple lines of flex items. Possible values:
- `stretch` (default): Lines are stretched to fill the available space.
- `flex-start`: Lines are packed toward the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Lines are packed toward the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Lines are centered along the cross axis.
- `space-between`: Lines are evenly distributed, with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.
- `space-around`: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around each line.

### `flex-wrap`
Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. Possible values:
- `nowrap` (default): All flex items will be on one line.
- `wrap`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines.
- `wrap-reverse`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.

### `gap`
Specifies the size of the gap between flex items. This property accepts one or two values:
- One value: Sets the gap between rows and columns.
- Two values: First value sets the row gap, second value sets the column gap.

### `order`
Specifies the order in which the flex item appears within the flex container.

### `flex-grow`
Specifies how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.

### `flex-shrink`
Specifies how much the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.

### `flex-basis`
Specifies the initial main size of the flex item before any free space is distributed according to the flex grow and flex shrink properties.

### `flex`
A shorthand property for the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties.

### `align-self`
Allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

## Flexbox Tasks

### Beginner Tasks

1. **Simple Flexbox Layout**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex`.
   - Add a header, main content area, and footer as child elements.
   - Set `flex-direction: column` on the parent container.
   - Give the header and footer a height of 80px and the main content area a flex-grow of 1 to fill the remaining space.
   - Center the child elements horizontally and vertically using `justify-content` and `align-items`.

2. **Responsive Navigation Menu**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` for the navigation menu.
   - Add list items as child elements representing the menu links.
   - Set `flex-direction: row` on the parent container.
   - Use `justify-content: space-between` to evenly distribute the menu items.
   - Make the menu responsive by adding a media query. At screen widths below 768px, switch to a vertical layout using `flex-direction: column`.

3. **Flexbox-based Card Layout**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to create a grid of cards.
   - Add card elements as child items.
   - Set a fixed width (e.g., 300px) and margin on the card elements.
   - Use `justify-content` and `align-items` to center the cards both horizontally and vertically.

### Intermediate Tasks

1. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: row` for the overall layout.
   - Add a sidebar element and a main content area as child elements.
   - Give the sidebar a fixed width (e.g., 200px) and the main content area a `flex-grow: 1` to fill the remaining space.
   - Vertically center the content within the sidebar and main content area using `align-items: center`.

2. **Pricing Table**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to create the pricing table layout.
   - Add pricing plan elements as child items.
   - Set a fixed width (e.g., 300px) and margin on the pricing plan elements.
   - Use `justify-content` and `align-items` to center the pricing plans both horizontally and vertically.
   - Adjust the spacing between pricing plans using the `gap` property.

3. **Flexbox Image Gallery**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` for the image gallery.
   - Add image elements as child items.
   - Set a fixed width and height (e.g., 200px) on the image elements.
   - Use `justify-content` and `align-items` to center the images both horizontally and vertically.
   - Adjust the spacing between images using the `gap` property.

### Advanced Tasks

1. **Complex Flexbox Layout**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` for the overall layout.
   - Add a header, sidebar, main content area, and footer as child elements.
   - Give the header and footer a fixed height (e.g., 80px).
   - Set the sidebar to have a fixed width (e.g., 200px) and the main content area to `flex-grow: 1` to fill the remaining space.
   - Vertically center the content within the header, sidebar, and footer using `align-items: center`.
   - Use additional Flexbox properties (e.g., `align-content`, `flex-wrap`) to create a responsive and flexible layout.

2. **Flexbox Carousel/Slider**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `overflow-x: hidden` for the carousel/slider.
   - Add slide elements as child items.
   - Set the slide elements to have a fixed width (e.g., 100%) and `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent them from shrinking.
   - Use `transform: translateX()` to animate the carousel/slider by updating the value of the `translateX` property.
   - Incorporate CSS transitions or JavaScript to create a smooth scrolling effect.

3. **Flexbox with Animations/Transitions**
   - Create a parent container with `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` for the layout.
   - Add child elements that will be animated or transitioned.
   - Use CSS animations or transitions to create dynamic effects, such as:
     - Fade in/out animations on element hover
     - Scale or rotate transformations on click
     - Smooth transitions when rearranging layout on window resize

Remember to experiment with the various Flexbox properties to achieve the desired layouts and effects. Feel free to adjust the dimensions and spacing as needed to suit your design requirements.

            <summary>What is responsive web design, and why is it important?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of
                    devices and window or screen sizes. This ensures that a website looks and functions well on
                    desktops,
                    tablets, and smartphones. It's important because it provides a seamless user experience across all
                    devices, which can increase user engagement, improve SEO rankings, and reduce bounce rates. With the
                    increasing use of mobile devices to access the internet, having a responsive design is essential for
                    reaching a broader audience.

            <summary>What are web design wireframes, and why are they used?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Web design wireframes are basic visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a website.
                    They
                    are used in the early stages of the design process to lay out the structure and functionality of a
                    website before adding any visual design or content. Wireframes help designers and stakeholders focus
                    on
                    the placement of elements, such as navigation, content, and CTAs (call-to-action buttons), without
                    being
                    distracted by colors, fonts, or images. This helps ensure that the design meets the user’s needs and
                    achieves the desired functionality.

                How does UX (User Experience) design differ from UI (User Interface) design?
            </summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>UX design (User Experience design) and UI design (User Interface design) are closely related but
                    focus on
                    different aspects of the user’s interaction with a product:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        UX Design: This involves the overall experience a user has with a website or application. It
                        encompasses various aspects such as usability, functionality, and the user journey. UX designers
                        focus on understanding the users, their needs, and how they interact with the product. Their
                        goal is
                        to create a product that is easy to use, efficient, and provides a positive experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        UI Design: This is concerned with the look and feel of the website or application. UI designers
                        focus on the visual aspects, such as layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements. Their
                        goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing interface that aligns with the brand’s identity and
                        enhances the overall user experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both UX and UI design are crucial for creating a successful product, and they often work closely
                    together
                    to ensure that the product is both functional and visually appealing.</p>
